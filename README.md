Goes from: ![Initial](http://i.imgur.com/0R8wvDV.png)To: ![After](http://i.imgur.com/Ke9N1DI.png)  
  
You can style the text in the settings to how you prefer.  
The separators are found by looking for 
```javascript
/^\w(\-|\_){2,}(\w)+.*/i
```

If you have any improvements for the regex or the code just message me.
